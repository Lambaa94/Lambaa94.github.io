                        <p> Full stack web developer with a long history in Hospitality. Recently worked in a high intensity pre-theatre, fine dining restaurant dealing with large guest counts. I showed that I have exceptional time management skills combined with great organizational skills to keep my guests on time and comfortable. Being a head staff member I would close the business on lucrative nights keeping high-profile clients captivated and carefree. Passionate about creating and inventing new, never thought about products. Excited to bring my passion into the workspace with my newly found knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and React.js. I have a fondness for creating products that are pleasing to the eye and highly functional at the same time. Working my way through college and a conservatory taught me to be able to successfully multitask two important tasks and keeping my composure under pressure. Looking to be a part of a team to design and create web applications that will benefit the masses.

                        On a more personal note, I have a big passion for food. Cooking and bringing people together with a great meal is one of my favourite things. I love the outdoors including camping, hiking, kayaking and snowbaording.  From a young age, I have spent many sleepless nights playing video games. This sparked my interest in coding and have always dreamed of being a part of a team that creates one of the things that has kept me endlessly entertained. With my knowledge that I have received from the University of Pennsylvania, I plan to rock the tech world and am very excited to begin my endeavour.

                        <br>
                        I've attended college at Rowan College at Burlington County in New Jersey where I studied for my first two years. I transitioned into my acting career in New York City at the American Muscial Dramatic Academy. While training at this conservatory, I fell deeper in love with the restaurant scene and started to bartend for some of the best restaurants in New York. I learned how to be a true team player and what it means to be a part of a well-oiled machine. Working in New York's restaurant scene, one acquires knowledge that is very hard to come by. It is a different animal when it comes to this stuff. New Yorkers take their food pretty seriously! My experience in this field has given me the resources to take what I know from the real world and apply it to our ever expanding web. The world is changing and advancing at a rapid pace, and it takes someone that is quick-witted and competent to get things done and done right.
