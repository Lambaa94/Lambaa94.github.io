## Description

### Summary

When starting this project I did not previously know how to work with *Bootstrap* or that much **css**. After diving into the grid system and understanding it more I was able to properly space out my website so I have a nice blank canvas to create on. Then I began to create and style it up so it looks not only professional but unique by adding my own custom ideas and some borrowed. Using *Bootstrap*, *Bootswatch*, and *Toptol*, I was able to create more than just the out of the box styles that was provided.

I started out first with the grid system by making my columns, rows, and sections. I linked the stylesheets to my **html** and gave everything on my page a basic title. This gave me something to start with and to build on. After that I began by going forward and placing my navbar and creating the contents of the page. After going through each page and tweaking all the measurements so that everything looked good and was responsive, I finished everything off with some background images and layouts.

I learned a good amount with this and quickly realized that with a lot of trial and error, there becomes a better understanding of coding. Excited to learn more about this and further my education in **javascript**.

## Usage
