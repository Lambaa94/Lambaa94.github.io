## Description

### Summary 
    When starting this project I did not previously know how to work with *Bootstrap* or that much **css**. After diving into the grid system and understanding it more I was able to properly space out my website so I have a nice blank canvas to create on. Then I began to create and style it up so it looks not only professional but unique by adding my own custom ideas and some borrowed. Using *Bootstrap*, *Bootswatch*, and *Toptol*, I was able to create more then just the out of the box style provided.

    I started out first with the grid system by make my columns, rows, and section. I linked the stylesheets to my **html**

### html
 
 I started out changing all generic`<div>` tags to tags that made more sense for me. I added alt= to all img tags to give a description to what the image was. I fixed a navigation link that wasn't working do to an absent id tag. I also created a logo for the title.

### css
 
 I condensed items that were the same code so there wasn't any code that was repeating itself. I moved the main three sections above the aside becuase I thought that it matched more what the **html** page was showing. I went through and made sure any changes I made on the **html** side matched up with **css**.
